# Description
I hope I've made setting more than intuitive, but I'd explain it to be sure:
1. Divider. Character that will divide song and artist words. Usually it's just `-`, but if You want to make Your own don't forget to add some `space` at the beginning and at the end.

2. Reverse. Some streamers uses Artist - Song format, some Song - Artist. I don't want to make sad someone so I've made it optional. 

3. Prefix. Just let it be. I've spent a lot of fun-time to make it so you have to be happy! Have an option to fill result as your own text like "No music for now, guys".
